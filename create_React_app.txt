Folder

Node-Module

1.First one is Node-Module .This is a folder were all dependencies are installed
a>>It is genrated when you run the create react app command or when you rum npm install

2.Second folder is public folder this folder contains three Files
a>>manifest.json which concern with progressive web apps which is out of scope for our discussion
b>>we have favicon icons see in the browser tab and nothing react specific
c>>Soo as bigner only concentrate index.html file 

1.we are building single page applications
2.veiw might dynamically change in the browser but it is HTML file that that gets served up
<<You Not going to add any code in this file maybe some changes in the head tag but not in body tag>>

>>You want react to control UI and for that purpose we have one div tag  withID is equal to root
at run time take the react application takes over this div tag .and responsible for UI

src

This is the folder most using in the development
1.Starting point for a react application is index.js

In index.js we have , root Component , app Component and the DOM element 
which will be controlled by react
"The DOM element in our Example is an element with an Id of root and
this is recollect this is the element inour index .html file we call this element 
as the root DOM node because everything inside it will be controlled by react  
for the hello world application the app component is rendered inside the root DOM node
That brings us to the app component which is present in app.js

it is reponsible for the HTML displayed in the browser

Other words the app component represent the veiw which we see in the browser
with app.js create react app also generate the CSS file for a styling test.js file for unit tests
the Css file contain classes which are applied in the app component and the test contain simple test case

we also have index.js CSS file which apply style to the style to the body tag and logo svg
which reference in the app component

finally we have serviceworker.js which is again concerned wiht progressive web app and can be ignore as a begninner

Index.html contains the Dom node next the control enters index.js in ths react dom contais component on the root dom node
