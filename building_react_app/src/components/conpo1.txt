//componenet code is placed in javascript file and app component placed in app.js
//Components are basically as a part of user userinterface
//component describe a part of the user inter face
//they are re usable and nested inside the other components
//these are of two type
//1.Stateless Functional component!!javaScript functions
function welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name} </h1>;
}

//Functional componenet is simple functions
//Use Func componenet as much as possible
//Absence of 'this' Keyword
//solution without using State
//Mainly responsible for the UI
//Stateless / Dumb / presentational 


//Functional component  ---accept an input of properties and returns HTML 
//THAT describe the UI

//2.Stateful class component
//class extending component class , // must have Render method returning HTML
class welcome extends React.component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello , {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}
//More feature rich
// Maintain their own private data : State
// complex UI logic
// Provide lifecycle hooks
// Stateful / Smart / Container

both of cases return html but it is something as JSX

JSX
>>javaScript XML (JSX) -Extension to the javaScript lanquage syntax
>>Write XML - like code for elements and components.
>>JSX tags have a tag name , attribute and children.
>>JSX is not a necessity to write React applications
>>JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant
