   Controlled components

                              this.state={
                                 email:''
                                }
                  this.changeEmailHandler = {event} => {
                     this.setState({email: event.target.value})
                        }

<input type='text' value={this.state.email}   onchange={this.changeEmailHandler}     />




We are working with a Controlled components and react state is the 
single source of truth for this input element

you can see that we have username as a state property which is supplied as a value 
attribute of  the input element whenever there is change that new value is propogated
to handle  username change which sets back the state property username to the updated
value and when the state is said the render method is called again the new value is available
to the value property and that is how we have controlled components

Next create controlled components for a text area as well as a select tag this
will also help you get used to the controlled components way of working with form elements
There are three simple steps
1. Add the element HTML assign the components state to the element value and assign an unchange handler that updates the state.
