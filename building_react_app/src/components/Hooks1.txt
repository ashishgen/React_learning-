What are Hooks?
Hooks are a new features addition in React version 16.8 which allow you to useState
React features without having to write a class.
Ex.State of a component

Hooks dont work inside classes

Why neccesity of Hooks in React?
Reason1.
Understand how this keywords works in JavaScript.
Remember to bind event handler in class components.
Classses dont minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable.

Reason2.
There is no particular way to reuse statefull component logic.
HOC and render props patterns do address this problem.
Makes the code harder to follow.
There is need a to share statefull logic in a better way.

Reason3
Create component for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events
Related code is not organised in one place
Ex: Data fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
Ex: Event listners - In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
Because of statefull logic - Cannot break components into smaller ones

Noteworthy Points
React version 16.8 or higher
completely opt in
Hooks dont contain any breaking changes and the release is 100% backwards-compatible.
Classes wont be removed from React.
Cant use Hooks inside of a class component.
Hooks dont replace your existing knowledge of React concept
Instead ,Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concept you already know.
