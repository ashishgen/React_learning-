There is a second way to create a class component and that is extending
the pure component class from react

What is difference between component class and pure component class? also when should be used one over the anotheer?
Ans.Regular Component-- A regular component does not implemet the shouldcomponentUpdate method.it always returns true by default.

Pure Component-- A pure component on the other hand implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow props and state comparison.

Shallow Comparision (SC)
Primitive Types--
a (SC) b returns true if a and b have the same value and are of the same type
Ex: string 'Ashish' (SC) string 'Ashish'  returns true


Complex Types--
a (SC) b returns true if a and b reference the exact same object.

var a = {1,2,4};
var b = {1,2,4};
var c = a;
var ab_eq = (a===b); //false
var ac_eq = (a===c); //true
