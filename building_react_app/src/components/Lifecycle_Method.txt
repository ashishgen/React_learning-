Lifecycle Methods have four phases

a>>Mounting--When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
b>>Updating--when a componentis being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
c>>Unmounting--When a component is being removed from the DOM
d>>Error Handling--When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor 
of any child component .

In the Updating State we have five methods are
1st. static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate

In the Unmounting State
