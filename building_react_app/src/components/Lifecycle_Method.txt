Lifecycle Methods have four phases

a>>Mounting--When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
b>>Updating--when a componentis being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
c>>Unmounting--When a component is being removed from the DOM
d>>Error Handling--When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor 
of any child component .


In the Mounting State we have four Methods
1st. constructor,static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and componentDidMount

Mounting Lifecycle Methods-
1st method. constructor(props)-A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
--It is used for Initializing state 
 Binding the event handlers to the class instances
--Do not cause side effects Ex.HTTP requests
--Your own Constructor 
super(props)
Directly overwrite this.state

2nd method.static method
      constructor(props)-When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time./Set the state
      static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)

3rd Method.is render method......
     constructor( props )------Only required method
     static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)-------Read props & state and return JSX
     render()--------------------------------------------But do not change state or intract with DOM or make ajax calls.
              -------------------------------------------THe children components lifecycle methods are also executed

4rth Method. constructor( props )---Invoke immediately after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM.
            static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)---Cause side effect Ex: Interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data.
            render()
            componentDidMount()






In the Updating State we have five methods are
1st. static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate

In the Unmounting State
only. componentWillUnmount

In the Error Handling 
static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch
