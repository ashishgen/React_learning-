Error Handling
Error boundaries are React components that catch javaScript error in their child components tree,
log those errors, and display a fall-back UI.

A class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either or both of getDerivedStateFromError
 and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.

The placememt of the Error Boundary also matters as it controls if the entire app should have the
fall-back UI or just the component causing the problem.
