  setState
  1. Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly
  2. Code has to be executed after the state has been update ? place
  that code in the call back function which is the second argument to the 
  etState method. 
  3.When you have to update state based on the previous 
  state value , pass in a function as an argument instead
  of the regular object.
